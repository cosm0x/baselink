## BaseLink Overview

BaseLink is a Dapp that enables users and small businesses to create USDT payment links on Base!

## Problem

Currently, social media-based business owners face significant barriers in receiving international payments. While they can easily market their products globally, converting international interest into actual sales remains a challenge. They can share long wallet addresses to receive payments but this is prone to typo error. This approach is also inconvenient for users or small businesses who want to track payments and inventory.

## Solution

BaseLink lets users create listings, share links, and receive USDT payments directly to their wallet. It's great for small businesses, donations, and community contributions. BaseLink has the benefits of:

- Eliminating error with long wallet addresses
- Enables cross border payments
- Inventory management
